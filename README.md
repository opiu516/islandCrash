# islandCrash

IslandCrash is a game that has one goal and it is showing my island creating algorith that spawns you on a different island everytime you start the game. I have added a player that 
can mine trees and rocks in the island which drop in his inventory. There is not a lot more to say than you can try it yourself.
controls: arrows - movemetn, "X" - hit/mine, "z,c" - cycle trough inventory "a" - drop item
